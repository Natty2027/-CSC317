<h2> About me </h2>
<p> Hi, I’m Nathan—a proud Navy veteran, financial professional, and aspiring attorney. With 12 years of service in the Navy and a deep passion for helping others, I’ve dedicated my career to empowering individuals and families through financial literacy and strategic planning. I’ve already helped over 100 families build financial security, and my mission is to impact 10 million more by 2035.
  Currently, I’m a Senior at San Francisco State University, preparing for law school while continuing my work in wealth accumulation, retirement planning, college funds, life insurance, asset protection, and tax engineering. I believe financial education is the key to breaking cycles of debt and creating lasting prosperity.
  Beyond my professional pursuits, I thrive on making people laugh and connecting with others. Whether it’s legal advocacy or financial guidance, my goal is simple—help people secure their future and live with confidence. Let’s build something great together!</p>
